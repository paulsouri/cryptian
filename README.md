# Cyptian

A chatbot based blockchain awareness and job notice platform with an innovative ed-tech platform for faster understanding and deployment of smart contracts. While the chatbot based idea derives job lists from LinkedIn and Angel.co, blockchain based awareness news come from Hackernews, and when one selects a smart contract developer or a smart contract verification lawyer, the innovative drag and drop illustrative contract builder comes up. The contract builder will be similar to the MIT App Inventor, thus allowing newcomers to understand the workings without getting overwhelmed. Also we have a mentoring platform for 1-on-1 video calling.
